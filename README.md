## 📚 Understanding the Basics

### What is Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning?

Neuro-symbolic reasoning combines neural networks and symbolic logic. This approach allows machines to understand complex reasoning tasks. With our tool, you can easily generate Prolog predicates that can then be justified through embedded chains of reasoning.

### Key Features

- **Automated Predicate Generation:** Generate Prolog predicates using advanced algorithms.
- **Justification Chains:** Each predicate comes with a clear justification chain to support academic validity.
- **High Correctness Rate:** Achieve 97.5% correctness in generated results based on a comprehensive study.

## 📝 Documentation

For more detailed information about how to use the application, instructions can be found in the project documentation. This will guide you through various functionalities and provide examples of use cases.

### Example Usage

Once installed, open the application. You can start generating predicates by simply entering your query in the provided text box. The application will process your request and return predicates along with their justification. Adjust your queries to explore the capabilities of neuro-symbolic reasoning.
